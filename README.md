Mahjong Poker with c++

Game: Mahjong Poker
This game is a variation on poker with some elements from mahjong. This game is inspired from a mention 
in the manga "Ten - Tenhoudouri no Kaidanji" by Nobuyuki Fukumoto. At the start of the game, each player draws 5 cards from the deck.
Throughout the game, each player will draw from the deck and discard a card from their hand. Through this process, the players are able
to change their hand as the game goes on.

How to win: When the deck is drawn up and is empty, each player will compare their hands. The player with the best hand wins.

Notes:
I started this project as I wanted The game is still in the making and is text-based. 
There is still lots to be done, but I hope to complete this by June 2020.
